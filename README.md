# TelegramBotTimeScheduler

If you have a group of cool people from around the world (some are from Canada, some - from europe, some - from japan) - it's a mess to schedule some events - because of timezone differences. 
This bot helps you a bit - you can show to everybody the scheduled time in their timezone. 
This how it works:
You (let's say, you are Przebek) put:

/settz Joe America/Toronto
/settz Taras Europe/Kiev
/settz Przebek Europe/Warsaw

Then you ask:

/expand 19:00

And receive into the chat:

@Joe 13:00
@Przebek 19:00
@Taras 20:00

That's it!

If you want to run this bot (i'm not sure I'll always keep it online, sorry for this) - you can go through any of numerous tutorials - to get your own token.

Note: this bot is bugged (I don't know for sure, but it **must** be), so please, feel free to improve it yourself or try to ask a feature, but I do not promise anything :)
